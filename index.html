        <p>Hi there! I'm Larissa, an aspiring human-centered technologist.
            I'm a rising junior at UC Berkeley, where I study ___, Cognitive Science, and Music.
            I am passionate about developing human-centered technology. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at Warner Bros. Discovery, where I am leveraging determinantal point processes to improve the personalization and discovery experience on CNN. 
            I also help incubate and accelerate undergraduate data science research as an Outreach Coordinator for the <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/discovery">Data Science Discovery Program</a>, through UC Berkeley's newly established College of Computing, Data Science, and Society.
            In the past, I developed an automated translation proof-of-concept at the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). 
            I've also utilized statistical modeling, trend analysis, and data visualization to formulate strategies aimed at improving SMUD's community engagement. 
        <br>
        <br>
            In my free time, you can find me playing the violin with the <a href="https://music.berkeley.edu/performance-ensembles/uc-berkeley-symphony-orchestra">UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra</a> or experimenting in the kitchen for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ourzookitchen/">cooking Instagram account</a>.
            You can also catch me running around North Berkeley or capturing memories with my camera.
        <br>
        <br>
            Thank you for stopping by! I'm happy to connect.
