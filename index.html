Larissa Yee

<p>Hi there! I'm Larissa: a curious & creative aspiring technologist.
    I'm a rising junior at the University of California, Berkeley, where I study ___, Cognitive Science, and Music.
    I am passionate about developing human-centered technology.

    I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at Warner Bros. Discovery, where you can find me leveraging determinantal point process models to improve the personalization and discovery experience on CNN.com. 
    In the past, I have developed proof-of-concepts for automated translation at the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.

    In my free time, you can find me playing the violin with the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra or experimenting in the kitchen for my cooking Instagram account.
    You can also catch me running around exploring North Berkeley. 

    Thank you for stopping by!
